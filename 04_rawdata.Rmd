## Raw Data

As raw data we define data that we receive from a device or from a project
partner. 

Most of our research results are based on data. We acknowledge the importance
of raw data by

* storing then in a special place where it is specially secured
* describing them with metadata

Rawdata are stored in the [rawdata folder structure](#rawdata-folder-structure)
