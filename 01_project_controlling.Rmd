## Data-Related Project Controlling

At the start of a research project

* Choose a [project acronym](#project-acronyms) and store it in 
[`PROJECTS.txt`](#file-projects).
* Check if the organisations that you expect to get data from are listed in
[`ORGANISATIONS.txt`](#file-organisations) and extend this file if necessary.
* Create a subfolder for your project and subfolders for the organisations
in the [rawdata folder structure](#rawdata-folder-structure).

At the start of a project or if an employee or trainee enters the project

* Give an introduction to our research data management as described in this 
document.

Regularly during the project 

* Check if the folder structure within your project's rawdata subfolder still 
complies with the [rawdata folder structure](#rawdata-folder-structure) and 
clean the structure, if not.
