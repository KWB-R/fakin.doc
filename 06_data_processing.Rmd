## Data Processing

### Automatic Data Import into R

In the following we describe how data can be imported into the R-Programming
Environment

#### Import Data From One Excel File

* Save the original file in the rawdata zone. 


#### Import Data From Many Excel Files

##### Files Are In the Same Format

Import Excel files of the same format by 

* defining a function that is able to read the data from that file
* calling this function in a loop for each file to import.

##### Files Are In Different Formats

We developed a general approach of importing data from many Excel files in which 
the formats (e.g. more than one table area within one sheet, differing numbers
of header rows) differ from file to file.
