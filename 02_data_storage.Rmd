###	Naming

\@Michael: Konventionen für Ordner- und Dateinamen, Vorschlag einer Nomenklatur
\@Michael: Regeln zur Vermeidung langer Dateipfade

Useful file names are: 

- consistent

- meaningful to you and your colleagues

- allow you to find the file easily

It is useful if your department/project agrees on the following elements of a 
file name: 

- Vocabulary – choose a standard vocabulary for file names, so that everyone 
uses a common language

- Punctuation – decide on conventions for if and when to use punctuation symbols, 
capitals, hyphens and spaces

- Dates – agree on a logical use of dates so that they display chronologically 
i.e. YYYY-MM-DD

- 	Order - confirm which element should go first, so that files on the same 
theme are listed together and can therefore be found easily

•	Numbers – specify the amount of digits that will be used in numbering so that 
files are listed numerically e.g. 01, 002, etc.


!!!!! Good practice: Remove spaces from file names or use punctuation such as 
underscores and hyphens to separate words e.g. “AHRC_TechnicalApp_Response20120925.docx” 
or “AHRC-TechnicalApp-Response20120925.docx” rather than “what we got back from 
funders about the data stuff.docx !!!!
  
###	Raw data

Especially in environmental sciences, raw data often cannot be reproduced (e.g. 
rainfall, river discharge measurements) and are therefore of high value.

-	dürfen umbenannt werden, dies muss in den Metadaten dokumentiert werden

-	dürfen inhaltlich nicht verändert werden

-	werden schreibgeschützt abgelegt

-	werden in einem eigenen Bereich abgelegt (ein Ordner enthält alle Rohdaten)




### Versioning

Versioning or version control is the way by which different versions and drafts 
of a document (or file or record or dataset or software code) are managed. 
Versioning involves the process of naming and distinguishing between a series 
of draft documents that leads to a final or approved version in the end. 
Versioning allows you to disclose an audit trail for the revision and update of 
drafts and final versions.


#### Manual 

We propose the following workflow:

- It is only allowed to modify the current file (e.g. `filename.pptx`), which 
contains no version name as postfix

- A version is created by copying the current file. This copy gets a not already 
defined version name as file name ending (e.g. `filename_v0.1.pptx`) 

- The versioned file is moved to a folder `VERSIONS" and set as read-only.

- In the folder `VERSIONS` is a file `VERSIONS.txt`, which contrains addtional 
information on the available version within that folder

**Drawbacks:**

* possibly more time demanding, 

* needs time getting used to it and

* requires high level of discipline


**Advantages:**

* Simple and safe method, which requires not version control software

* Cleaner workspace as old versions are stored in a separate folder

* Sorting by name equals the chronology

**Example:**

```
BestPractices_Workshop.ppt
VERSIONS/
  + VERSIONS.txt
  + BestPractices_Workshop_v0.1.ppt
  + BestPractices_Workshop_v0.2.ppt
  + BestPractices_Workshop_v1.0.ppt
```

Content of file `VERSIONS.txt`:

```
BestPractices_Workshop.ppt
- v0.1: first draft version, written by Michael Rustler
- v0.2: after additions by Hauke Sonnenberg
- v1.0: first final version, after review by Pascale Rouault
```

#### Automatically

The versioning is done automatically in case a version control software, 
like [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) or [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) 
are used. 

At KWB we currently use the following version controll software: 

- Subversion: for KWB r. Requires connection to the KWB intranet

- Git: for publishing programm code external on our KWB organisation group on 
[Github](https://github.com/KWB-R). Currently all repositories are public (i.e. 
are visible for everyone), but also use of private repositories is possible for 
free as KWB is recognised as non-for-profit company by Github, offering [additional
benefits for free](https://help.github.com/articles/discounted-organization-accounts/#discounts-for-nonprofits-and-libraries)

Use of version control software is required in case of programming (e.g. in R, 
Python, and so on) and can be useful in case of tracking changes in small text 
files (e.g. configuration files that run a specific R script with different 
parameters for scenario analysis). 


**Drawbacks:**

* Special software (TortoiseSVN), login data for each user on KWB-Server and 
some basic training are required

* In case of collaborate coding: sticking to 'best-practices' for using version 
control is mandatory, e.g.: 
 
    + timely check in of code changes to the central server, 
    
    + Speaking to each other: so that not two people work at the same time at the 
    same program code in one script as this leads to conflicts that need to be 
    resolved manually, which can be quite time demanding. You are much better off 
    if you avoid this in the upfront by talking to each other

**Advantages:**

* Only one filename per script (file history and code changes are managed either 
internally on a KWB server in case of using TortoiseSVN or externally for code 
hosted on Github) 

* Old versions of scripts can be restored easily 

* Additional comments during `commit` (i.e. at the time of transfering the code 
from the local computer to the central version control system about `why` code 
changes were made and build-in diff-tools for tracking changes improve the 
reproducibility

Attention: version contral software is not designed for versioning of raw data 
and thus should not be used for it. General thoughts on the topic of 'data 
versioning' are available here: [https://github.com/leeper/data-versioning](https://github.com/leeper/data-versioning)

###	Organising your e-mail account

From: [https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/data-management-guide/organising-your-data#Refernces](https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/data-management-guide/organising-your-data#Refernces)
Most people now routinely send and receive lots of messages every day and as a 
esult, their inbox can get very quickly overloaded with hundreds of personal and
work-related email. Setting aside some time to organise your emails will ensure 
information can be found quickly and easily, and is stored securely.
Why should I organise my email?
Apart from the obvious frustration and time wasted looking for that email you 
remember sending to someone last month, email is increasingly used to store 
important documents and data, often with information related to the attachments 
within the email itself.
How can I ensure my emails remain organised?

Here are some general tips to ensure your email remains organised in the long 
term:

- Delete emails you do not need. Remove any trivial or old messages from your 
inbox and sent items on a regular (ideally daily) basis.

- 	Use folders to store messages. Establish a structured file directory by 
subject, activity or project.

-	Separate personal emails. Set up a separate folder for these. Ideally, you 
should not receive any personal emails to your work email account.

-	Limit the use of attachments. Use alternative and more secure methods to 
exchange data where possible (see ‘data sharing’ for options). If attachments 
are used, exercise version control and save important attachments to other 
places, such as a network drive.


### Managing references 

Refer to KWB Endnote guidelines….

###	Metadata
What information would someone need to find/re-use your data?
Location, title, creator name, description, date collected

-	keep metadata in plain text file “readme.txt”

Tools for metadata tracking and data standards are:

-	Metadatenstandards prüfen, z. B. DataCite (siehe u.a. ZALF, GFZ Potsdam)


###	Data preservation
Data must be retained to support your research findings

Standards: ?5 years?
