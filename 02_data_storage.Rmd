Useful file names are: 

- consistent

- meaningful to you and your colleagues

- allow you to find the file easily

It is useful if your department/project agrees on the following elements of a 
file name: 

- Vocabulary – choose a standard vocabulary for file names, so that everyone 
uses a common language

- Punctuation – decide on conventions for if and when to use punctuation symbols, 
capitals, hyphens and spaces

- Dates – agree on a logical use of dates so that they display chronologically 
i.e. YYYY-MM-DD

- 	Order - confirm which element should go first, so that files on the same 
theme are listed together and can therefore be found easily

•	Numbers – specify the amount of digits that will be used in numbering so that 
files are listed numerically e.g. 01, 002, etc.


!!!!! Good practice: Remove spaces from file names or use punctuation such as 
underscores and hyphens to separate words e.g. “AHRC_TechnicalApp_Response20120925.docx” 
or “AHRC-TechnicalApp-Response20120925.docx” rather than “what we got back from 
funders about the data stuff.docx !!!!
  
###	Raw data

Especially in environmental sciences, raw data often cannot be reproduced (e.g. 
rainfall, river discharge measurements) and are therefore of high value.

-	dürfen umbenannt werden, dies muss in den Metadaten dokumentiert werden

-	dürfen inhaltlich nicht verändert werden

-	werden schreibgeschützt abgelegt

-	werden in einem eigenen Bereich abgelegt (ein Ordner enthält alle Rohdaten)




### Versioning
Versioning or version control is the way by which different versions and drafts of a document (or file or record or dataset or software code) are managed. Versioning involves the process of naming and distinguishing between a series of draft documents that leads to a final or approved version in the end. Versioning allows you to disclose an audit trail for the revision and update of drafts and final versions.

!!!!      Keep older version in one place (i.e. folder) !!!!!


#### 	R scripts 

•	Verpflichtend für Programmcode und ggf. kleinerer Textdateien
•	Aber: nicht geeignet für Rohdatenversionsverwaltung



###	Organising your e-mail account

From: [https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/data-management-guide/organising-your-data#Refernces](https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/data-management-guide/organising-your-data#Refernces)
Most people now routinely send and receive lots of messages every day and as a 
esult, their inbox can get very quickly overloaded with hundreds of personal and
work-related email. Setting aside some time to organise your emails will ensure 
information can be found quickly and easily, and is stored securely.
Why should I organise my email?
Apart from the obvious frustration and time wasted looking for that email you 
remember sending to someone last month, email is increasingly used to store 
important documents and data, often with information related to the attachments 
within the email itself.
How can I ensure my emails remain organised?

Here are some general tips to ensure your email remains organised in the long 
term:

- Delete emails you do not need. Remove any trivial or old messages from your 
inbox and sent items on a regular (ideally daily) basis.

- 	Use folders to store messages. Establish a structured file directory by 
subject, activity or project.

-	Separate personal emails. Set up a separate folder for these. Ideally, you 
should not receive any personal emails to your work email account.

-	Limit the use of attachments. Use alternative and more secure methods to 
exchange data where possible (see ‘data sharing’ for options). If attachments 
are used, exercise version control and save important attachments to other 
places, such as a network drive.


### Managing references 

Refer to KWB Endnote guidelines….

###	Metadata
What information would someone need to find/re-use your data?
Location, title, creator name, description, date collected

-	keep metadata in plain text file “readme.txt”

Tools for metadata tracking and data standards are:

-	Metadatenstandards prüfen, z. B. DataCite (siehe u.a. ZALF, GFZ Potsdam)


###	Data preservation
Data must be retained to support your research findings

Standards: ?5 years?
