code files in which no one knows which results were derived from which raw data 
using which code files."

This document is the outcome of the KWB project [FAKIN](http://www.kompetenz-wasser.de/en/project/fakin-research-data-management) 
(Forschungsdatenmanagement an kleinen Instituten = research data management at small institutes).

It defines best practices for research data management. It is mainly based on
the personal experiences of the authors having worked in many different 
research projects at KWB.

The document is outlined as follows:

* [Chapter 1](#introduction) explains why and for whom research data management 
is important

* [Chapter 2](#best-practices) defines Best Practices for different topics.

* [Chapter 3](#case-studies) gives an overview on three [case studies](#case-studies) 
with different data related tasks that have been solved within the FAKIN project, 
while 

* [Chapter 4](#other-projects) what data challenges occured in the past in other 
KWB projects and how they were solved in order to increase our awareness at KWB, 
  
* [Chapter 5](#faq) provides FAQs and finally 

* [Chapter 6](#glossary) is a [glossary](#glossary) for explaining commonly used 
terms within this document.

This document is assumed to be a "living" document. We highly appreciate any
comments and suggestions for improvements. What are your experiences with
research data managment tasks? Can you provide solutions for specific tasks?
