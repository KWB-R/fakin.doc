# Introduction {#index}

> "These days, data trails are often a morass of separate data and results and 
code files in which no one knows which results were derived from which raw data 
using which code files."

This document is the outcome of the KWB project [FAKIN](http://www.kompetenz-wasser.de/en/project/fakin-research-data-management) 
(Forschungsdatenmanagement an kleinen Instituten = research data management at small institutes).

It defines best practices for research data management. It is mainly based on
the personal experiences of the authors having worked in many different 
research projects at KWB.

The document is outlined as follows:

* [Chapter 2](#best-practices) defines Best Practices for different topics.
* [Chapter 3](#projects) gives overviews about KWB projects and lists how different data related tasks have been solved within these projects.

This document is assumed to be a "living" document. We highly appreciate any
comments and suggestions for improvements. What are your experiences with
research data managment tasks? Can you provide solutions for specific tasks?
