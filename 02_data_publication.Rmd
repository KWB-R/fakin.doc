>"This figure provides a framework for understanding how the “Ten Simple Rules to
Enable Multi-site Collaborations through Data Sharing” `r citep("10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005278")`
can be translated into easily understood modern life concepts.
>
**Rule 1** is Open-Source Software. The openness is signified by a window to a room 
>filled with algorithms that are represented by gears. 
>
**Rule 2** involves making the source data available whenever possible. Source data 
>can be very useful for researchers. However, data are often housed in 
>institutions and are not publicly accessible. These files are often stored 
>externally; therefore, we depict this as a shed or storehouse of data, which, 
>if possible, should be provided to research collaborators. 
>
**Rule 3** is to “use multiple platforms to share research products.” This 
>increases thechances that other researchers will find and be able to utilize your 
>research product—this is represented by multiple locations (i.e., shed and house). 
>
**Rule 4** involves the need to secure all necessary permissions a priori. Many 
>datasets have data use agreements that restrict usage. These restrictions can 
>sometimes prevent researchers from performing certain types of analyses or 
>publishing in certain journals (e.g., journals that require all data to be 
>openly accessible); therefore, we represent this rule as a key that can lock or 
>unlock the door of your research. 
>
**Rule 5** discusses the privacy issues that surround source data. Researchers 
>need to understand what they can and cannot do (i.e., the privacy rules) with 
>their data. Privacy often requires allowing certain users to have access to 
>sections of data while restricting access to other sections of data. Researchers 
>need to understand what can and cannot be revealed about their data (i.e., when 
>to open and close the curtains). 
>
**Rule 6** is to facilitate reproducibility whenever possible. Since 
communication is the forte of reproducibility, we depicted it as two 
researchers sharing a giant scroll, because data documentation is required and 
is often substantial. 
>
**Rule 7** is to “think global.” We conceptualize this as a cloud. This cloud 
allows the research property (i.e., the house and shed) to be accessed across 
large distances. 
>
>**Rule 8** is to publicize your work. Think of it as “shouting from the rooftops.”
Publicizing is critical for enabling other researchers to access your research
product. 
>
>**Rule 9** is to “stay realistic.” It is important for researchers to “stay
grounded” and resist the urge to overstate the claims made by their research.
>
**Rule 10** is to be engaged, and this is depicted as a person waving an “I heart
research” sign. It is vitally important to stay engaged and enthusiastic about
one’s research. This enables you to draw others to care about your research."

###	Repositories 

Repositories for permanently deposing data are for example:

- General

    + [Figshare](https://figshare.com), 

    + [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (a joint project between 
    [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) and [CERN](https://home.cern/)),

    + [Mendeley data](https://data.mendeley.com/), 

    + [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/),

    + [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/)
    
- Focus on environmental and earth sciences

    + [Pangea](https://www.pangaea.de/)
    
    + [GFZ Potsdam data services](http://dataservices.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/)
  

In addition repositories for publishing program code are for example 
[Github](https://github.com) or [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), however these do 
not offer build-in long term preservation by default.


We are currently using the following repositories and can recommend them for 
similar usage to others: 

- [Github](https://github.com): for developing/publishing program code, because 
it offers the opportunity to automatically get a


- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) for each software 
released publicly on Github (for details see: https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)

A [blog post](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/github-and-more-sharing-data-code/)  
@Bosman_2016 provide results of a large survey carried out in 2015 among more 
than 15000 researchers. Insights can be gained on:   

- Which scholary communications tools are used and

- Are there disciplinary differences in usage?

They finally summarise:
"Another surprising finding is the overall low use of Zenodo – a CERN-hosted 
repository that is the recommended archiving and sharing solution for data from 
EU-projects and -institutions. The fact that Zenodo is a data-sharing platform 
that is available to anyone (thus not just for EU project data) might not be 
widely known yet."
```

### ORCID

Problem:

>"Two large challenges that researchers face today are discovery and evaluation. 
We are overwhelmed by the volume of new research works, and traditional discovery 
tools are no longer sufficient. We are spending considerable amounts of time 
optimizing the impact—and discoverability—of our research work so as to support 
grant applications and promotions, and the traditional measures for this are not 
enough.

Solution:

>"Open Researcher & Contributor ID ([ORCID](http://orcid.org/)) is an international, interdisciplinary, open and not-for-profit organization created to solve the 
researcher name ambiguity problem for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
[ORCID](http://orcid.org/)was built with the goal of becoming the universally 
accepted unique identifier for researchers: 
>
>1. ORCID is a community-driven organization
>
>2. ORCID is not limited by discipline, institution, or geography
>
>3. ORCID is an inclusive and transparently governed not-for profit organization
>
>4. ORCID data and source code are available under recognized open licenses
>
>5. the ORCID iD is part of institutional, publisher, and funding agency 
infrastructures.
>
>Furthermore, [ORCID](http://orcid.org/) recognizes that existing researcher and 
identifier schemes serve specific communities, and is working to link with, 
rather than replace, existing infrastructures."

[WaterML2](http://www.waterml2.org/): 

>"...is a new data exchange standard in Hydrology which can basically be used to 
exchange many kinds of hydro-meteorological observations and measurements. 
WaterML2 has been initiated and designed over a period of several years by a 
group of major national and international organizations from public and private 
sector, such as CSIRO, CUAHSI, USGS, BOM, NOAA, KISTERS and others. WaterML2 has
