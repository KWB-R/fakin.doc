## Plan and Fund a New Project

### Data Management Plan

Action 1: Look through a data management planning checklist 
[DMP checklist](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/checklist)?
  
Action 2: Create a data management plan. You can use [DMP Online](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) 
as it has a template or if required, use a funder's format.

### Electronic Lab Notebooks

Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) https://www.labfolder.com/research-data-management/
ELNs are an essential asset for researchers to fulfil any requirements for data 
management, and they create direct bridges between scientists and stakeholders. 
By adopting an ELN, the data lifecycle can proceed smoothly and easily: from 
creating and collecting data digitally in one place to one-click data archiving, 
ELNs empower researchers by allowing them to implement their RDM plan without 
effort and time investment.

An ELN to make your data FAIR? Welches ist das?

### Define Acronyms {#acronyms}

Acronyms are unique, clear names for objects. They should 

* be short but meaningful and easy to remember, 
* be all lowercase,
* consist of only alphanumeric letters (`a-z`, `0-9`) or the hyphen (`-`). 

#### Acronyms for Projects {-#project-acronyms}

```{block2 type = "rmdnote"}
Do we already have rules for naming and spelling of projects and project folders 
or files? 
```

If not, we should, at the start of a project, define official project acronyms.
These are uniform spellings of project names, intended to be used in folder or 
file names.

Whenever we want to indicate the relation to a certain project in a file or 
folder name, we use the project acronym in exactly the typing that was defined.
This is important as we want to distinguish between [raw data](#raw-data), 
processed data and 
project results in our [data workflow](#data-workflow).

The project acronyms are defined in a simple text file 
[`PROJECTS.txt`](#file-projects) in the `//server/projects$` folder, see 
[Project Folder Structure](#project-folder-structure).

```{block2 type = "rmdnote"}
Should we also define three letter codes for projects? That could
be beneficial in tables with each column representing a project or in overview 
plots.
```

#### Acronyms for Organisations {-#organisation-acronyms}

It is very important to know the origin or owner of data. This is an important
piece of [metadata](#metadata) Therefore we define unique acronyms for the
owners of data that we use. The acronyms are defined in a special file
[`ORGANISATIONS.txt`](#file-organisations) 

At the start of a research project

* Choose a [project acronym](#project-acronyms) and store it in 
[`PROJECTS.txt`](#file-projects).
* Check if the organisations that you expect to get data from are listed in
[`ORGANISATIONS.txt`](#file-organisations) and extend this file if necessary.
* Create a subfolder for your project and subfolders for the organisations
in the [rawdata folder structure](#rawdata-folder-structure).

At the start of a project or if an employee or trainee enters the project

* Give an introduction to our research data management as described in this 
document.

Regularly during the project 

* Check if the folder structure within your project's rawdata subfolder still 
complies with the [rawdata folder structure](#rawdata-folder-structure) and 
clean the structure, if not.
