# Best Practices {#best-practices}

## Plan and fund a new project

### Data management plan

Action 1: Look through a data management planning checklist 
[DMP checklist](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/checklist)?
  
Action 2: Create a data management plan. You can use [DMP Online](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) 
as it has a template or if required, use a funder's format.

### Electronic Lab Notebooks

Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) https://www.labfolder.com/research-data-management/
ELNs are an essential asset for researchers to fulfil any requirements for data 
management, and they create direct bridges between scientists and stakeholders. 
By adopting an ELN, the data lifecycle can proceed smoothly and easily: from 
creating and collecting data digitally in one place to one-click data archiving, 
ELNs empower researchers by allowing them to implement their RDM plan without 
effort and time investment.

An ELN to make your data FAIR? Welches ist das?

#### Project acronyms {#project-acronyms}

At the start of a project we define a project acronym. This acronym is
intended to be used in file and folder names. 

Whenever we want to indicate the relation to a certain project in a file or 
folder name, we use the project acronym in exactly the typing that was defined.
This is important as we want to distinguish between raw data, processed data and 
project results in our [Folder Structures](#folder-structures).

The project acronyms are defined in a simple text 
file [`PROJECTS.txt`](#file-projects) in the `//server/projects$` folder, see 
[Project Folder Structure](#project-folder-structure).
