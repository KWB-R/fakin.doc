## Plan and fund a new project

### Data management plan

Action 1: Look through a data management planning checklist 
[DMP checklist](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/checklist)?
  
Action 2: Create a data management plan. You can use [DMP Online](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) 
as it has a template or if required, use a funder's format.

### Electronic Lab Notebooks

Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) https://www.labfolder.com/research-data-management/
ELNs are an essential asset for researchers to fulfil any requirements for data 
management, and they create direct bridges between scientists and stakeholders. 
By adopting an ELN, the data lifecycle can proceed smoothly and easily: from 
creating and collecting data digitally in one place to one-click data archiving, 
ELNs empower researchers by allowing them to implement their RDM plan without 
effort and time investment.

An ELN to make your data FAIR? Welches ist das?

### Define acronyms

At the start of a research project

* Choose a [project acronym](#project-acronyms) and store it in 
[`PROJECTS.txt`](#file-projects).
* Check if the organisations that you expect to get data from are listed in
[`ORGANISATIONS.txt`](#file-organisations) and extend this file if necessary.
* Create a subfolder for your project and subfolders for the organisations
in the [rawdata folder structure](#rawdata-folder-structure).

At the start of a project or if an employee or trainee enters the project

* Give an introduction to our research data management as described in this 
document.

Regularly during the project 

* Check if the folder structure within your project's rawdata subfolder still 
complies with the [rawdata folder structure](#rawdata-folder-structure) and 
clean the structure, if not.
