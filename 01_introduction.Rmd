# Introduction {#introduction}

A very good book on how research data management (RDM) improves reproducibility 
is provided by `r citet(manual["Kitzesetal_2018"])` and available online at: 
[http://practicereproducibleresearch.org/](http://practicereproducibleresearch.org/).

## Why RDM ? 

Doing research data management (RDM) is useful according to [Labfolder.com (2018)](https://www.labfolder.com/research-data-management/) as it:

- Saves time for research

- Avoids risk of data loss

- Ensures transparency and reproducibility

- Increases data visibility and number of citations

- Fulfills funders’ requirements and receives more grants

- Produces new knowledge and makes more discoveries just by re-using data

- Archives, retrieves and re-uses own data.
