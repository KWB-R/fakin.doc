# Introduction {#introduction}

A very good book on how research data management (RDM) improves reproducibility 
is provided by `r citet(manual["Kitzesetal_2018"])` which also is available online
at [http://practicereproducibleresearch.org/](http://practicereproducibleresearch.org/).

## Why RDM ? 

Doing research data management (RDM) is useful according to [Labfolder.com (2018)](https://www.labfolder.com/research-data-management/) as it:

- Saves time for research

- Avoids risk of data loss

- Ensures transparency and reproducibility

- Increases data visibility and number of citations

- Fulfill funders’ requirements and receive more grants

- Produce new knowledge and make more discoveries just by re-using data

- Archive, retrieve and re-use own data
